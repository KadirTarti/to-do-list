# To-Do List APP (js)

https://to-do-list-2024.netlify.app

## Description 🟢

Hello everyone! The purpose of this project is to extract weather information from a weatherapi and print this information on cards with icons. When you enter the name of the city whose weather you want to query in the input field on the main screen, the weather information appears with additional information. Both English and German inquiry options are available on the page. The screen is not completely refreshed with each new query, the previous result remains on the screen. To remove the previous search result from the screen, the x button in the upper right corner of the card structure must be clicked.
